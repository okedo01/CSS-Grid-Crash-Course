          <h2>Baboon</h2>
          <p>
            The baboon, like other Old World monkeys, does not have a prehensile
            (gripping) tail — meaning their tails are not used as a hand — but
            they are still able to climb when necessary. They all have dog-like
            noses, powerful jaws, sharp canine teeth, and thick fur. Males have
            a longer mane around the neck, called a ruff

          <h3>Baboon</h3>
          <p>
            Baboons, who are at least as intelligent as human toddlers, have
            long been known for their brainpower, despite not as bright as their
            primate counterparts like chimps or the great apes.

          <h3>Lion Cub</h3>
          <p>
            Lions are the only cats that live in
            groups. A group, or pride, can be up to 30 lions, depending on how
            much food and water is available. Female lions are the main hunters.
            While they're out looking for food, the males guard the pride's
            territory and their young.
